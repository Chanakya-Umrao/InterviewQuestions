How Does Java Work

Java consists of three things

JDK, JVM, JRE

JDK consists of JRE and all the development tools such as compiler, debugger or other tools required to build up application

JRE consists of JVM and all the other files such as library files like util, awt, lang packages.

JVM consists of interpreter and compiler

First we install JDK, then we have to set environment variables, this is done because the computer would have no knowledge
of java compiler command javac

now we write our program and save it anywhere we want.

after this in that directory run javac, this will compile the program and will save it into a bytecode as a class
file. for eg javac Abc.java

after this to run the class file we will simply write command java Abc.class, by this the jvm will start working on
the class file to convert to machine language using interpreter, which will convert the bytecode to machine language,
jit compiler is also part of jvm, when interpreter sees methods getting repeated, jit provides direct native code for
that part so that re-interpretation is not required.

There are also class loaders

bootstrap class loader - searches for native classes
extension class loader - searches for lib classes
application class loader - searches in present directories

if a class is not found in either then class not found error is thrown, the finding of class is first in bootstrap then
in extension then in application.
