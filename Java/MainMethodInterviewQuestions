1.Can we use String... args instead of String[] args
yes we can use String..., ... simply means we have variable arguments, suppose a method has parameter int...,
that means that method can be method(1) or method(1,2,3,4), it can take variable number of arguments.
2.Can we overload main method?
yes we can overload main method but jvm will always call the main method with String[] args or String... args.
3.Can we override main method?
No we can not override main method as main method is static in nature and we can not override static methods.
4.Can we make main method final?
Yes we can
5.How to call non static method from main, Create object of class the method is in and then simply call the method.
6.Can we make main Synchronized?
Yes we can.
7.Why is main method static?
Suppose a class has two constructors with different parameters, the upon type of initialization of object, jvm would have got confused
due to the ambiguity on which method it should select, this is my main method is static.
8.What happen if we declare main method non-static?
Run Time Error
9.Can we declare class which we have to run without main method?
Only till Java5.
10.Can we declare main method with different access modifier than public?
No we can not, it will throw rte.
11.Can we change return type of main method?
No, it will throw rte.
12.If we make a program with main having (int args), then it will not have compile time error, but will not run as
jvm will look for main with (String[] args)
13.If we make a program with main having (String[] args) and (String... args) then it will have compile
time error
