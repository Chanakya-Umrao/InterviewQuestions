Sql query to create database
create database databasename, if error thrown means database present we can use create database if not exists databasename
to prevent error

to create table first select database, use dbname
then to create table create table(id int not null, name varchar(250) not null, address varchar(500))

to copy a table use create table tbname as (select * from tbname2), this will create same structure as well as same data
we can use where condition such as 1=2 in above select if we only want some limited data

Nth highest salary
Select * from table order by salary desc limit n-1,1(because 0 based indexing)

SQL Query to find managers
Select * from employees where employee_id in (select manager_id from managers)

Name of all employees starting with a
Select * from employees where e_name like a%

alternate records - id % 2 == 1 or 0

duplicate records
select name, count(*) from table group by name having count(name) > 1

Common records from 2 tables
Select * from employee inner join emp on employee.id = emp.id

Delete duplicate records
Delete E1 from Employee E1 inner join Employee E2 where E1.id < E2.id and E1.name = E2.name

If we have to get top n then simply use select * from employee limit 5

Sql to find employees without distinct
Select dept_id from Employee A where A.id >= All(Select B.id from Employee B where A.dept_id = B.dept_id) order by
dept_id;

Find max salary of each dept
select dept_id, Max(salary) from employee group by dept_id

Find department wise count of employees sorted by department count in ascending order
Select dept.name, count(*) as count from employee e inner join department d on e.dept_id = d.id group by d.name
order by count
or
select dept_id, count(dept_id) from employee group by dept_id order by count(dept_id)

change datatype of column
alter table modify column new_data_type

Table Field and Record
Table collection of row and column, entire data
Field eg = id, name, address
Record = 1, a, 25

Unique key can have only one null value per column, we can modify unique key column values but not of primary key

Inner Join = returns matching value in both tables
Cross Join  = cross product of joins
Self Join = join table within itself

Truncate
delete all the rows and columns from the table, can't be retrieved back

Drop
drops entire table, can be retrieved back

Delete
used to delete rows based on some condition

Constraints
Rule to specify the rules that we can apply to the type of data
Column level constraint used for particular columns, table level used for entire table

Difference in and between
in is used such as where salary in(2500,26000,28000) only these values will be included
between is for getting values between specific values

To summarize, the main difference between WHERE and HAVING is:

WHERE is used to filter individual rows before any grouping or aggregation takes place.
HAVING is used to filter the result set after grouping and aggregation have occurred. It operates on the grouped rows.
